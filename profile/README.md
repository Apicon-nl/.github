## What is RPA?

RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation. It is a technology that allows you to automate repetitive time-consuming tasks that would normally have to be performed manually.
In contrast to complex and expensive IT projects, RPA is easy to apply, accessible and very affordable.
Thanks to the user-friendliness of RPA, it can be applied quickly and easily within any company or organization. This has made it a valuable instrument in the pursuit of optimized business operations.
Take advantage of the unprecedented possibilities of RPA and discover with us what this innovation can do for you.

## What are we doing?

Content teams often work with different software and platforms. We have found a way to apply RPA seamlessly across the board without the need to move away from existing systems.
We use RPA in combination with AI and APIs. We are at the forefront of the application of this technology for content companies and already work with market leaders such as Roularta Netherlands, Ahold Delhaize, Hoogvliet and DPG Media.
Apicon easily integrates with existing software, tools and platforms with minimal impact on the organization and maximum impact on efficiency.
We would be happy to visit you to see together where RPA can be successfully applied within your company.

## How does it work?

RPA are software bots that can interact with digital systems and applications in the same way as a human user would.
Such an RPA scenario always consists of a trigger (a new email, a new file in Dropbox, a status change in your DAM, CRM or PM) and a subsequent action and a result (output).
Bots can also be linked together. In this way, even seemingly complex tasks can be taken over relatively easily.

## What are the advantages?

Saving time and costs. A bot works faster and cheaper than a human. In addition, a bot is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and always performs the work flawlessly.
Increasing productivity and reducing workload. By replacing repetitive time-consuming tasks with bots, employees have more time to work on other, more important matters. This allows them to perform better and get more satisfaction from their work.
Easy implementation and integration. RPA is an accessible form of automation, is fast and relatively easy to apply and therefore very affordable. It offers numerous possibilities for every organization.
Short payback period. RPA does not require high investments. In addition to the one-off costs for development and implementation, you only pay a small monthly amount for license, support and maintenance (SLA). The higher the volume and the more time employees previously spent on a particular task, the more RPA you yield when this task is taken over by a bot.
